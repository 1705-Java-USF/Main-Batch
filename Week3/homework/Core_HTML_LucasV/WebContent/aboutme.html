		<h1>-Lucas Vance</h1>
		<div class='aboutmepara'>
			<p>Hello! My name is Lucas Paul Vance. I was born in Morristown, NJ and grew up in Parsippany, NJ
			 which is about a 30 minute drive to Manhattan, NYC. I originally started my college education at
			 The College of New Jersey, where I studied Computer Engineering for two years. After my first two
			 years, I found opportunities in Taiwan to learn software and the Chinese language. I
			 transferred to Tamkang University and completed the last two years of my Bachelors Degree and
			 graduated with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Software Engineering. I am very excited to be
			 apart of Revature and have the opportunity to go through the training!</p>
